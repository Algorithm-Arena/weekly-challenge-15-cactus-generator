# Weekly Challenge #15 - Cactus Generator

**For this challenge, you need to implement a way to randomly generate images of cactus.** Generating tree branches is a common tech project, but since it has already been done so many times, a variation that can be interesting is to generate cactus leaves and flowers instead.

### Winners:

The winner of $125 is @nikpundik with Cactus Tycoon 3D! A recursive actor model was used on a 3d shape making it look very realistic! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-15-cactus-generator
